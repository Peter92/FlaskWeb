# FlaskWebsite
Making the backend of a website using Flask for Python. 

I'm aiming to create it with a lot of optional features for small scale websites. I'm unsure how it will hold up under heavier load.

## Features
 - User registration with secure password hashing
 - Track user details (from browser details to which pages were visited when)
 - Custom private sessions for each user
 - Protection against multiple types of attacks (eg. login rate limiting, CSRF, XSS)
 - Custom error page with tracking
 - Easy to setup pages with requirements (eg. login required)
 - Redirect to previous page on login
 - Clean temporary database records
